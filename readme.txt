A rotating odometer style counter widget that can display either a static value
or animate to a predefined total. Great for tracking any totals,
not just for counting jellyfish.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add a widgets to your WordPress web site that can display
a static or animated odometer style counter. The counter can be used as a manually
updated total, an automatic counter updating over time or just as an animated
visual effect.

The counter can either count upwards or downwards and is suitable for both incrementing
totals or countdown situations.

A great visual effect for travel blogs or any website that wants to display a
running total of anything.

You can have as many counters as you wish, all can have individual settings for
totals and appearance.

The counters are highly configurable through the widget interface and are generated
using CSS and Javascript, requiring no external graphics files.


Demo

You can see a counter in action at http://sharkaroo.net/map
Using an animated counter adds visual and narrative impact to an otherwise
static value.

Another demo and further information can be found at the plugin website

This plugin uses a modified version of a javascript odometer class written by
Gavin Brock http://gavcode.wordpress.com/2008/04/07/cssjavascript-animated-odometer/


==Usage==

Add a counter widget to your sidebar and adjust the settings to suit your
requirements.

There are three basic modes of operation:

* Static - If you want the counter to simply display a non animate number just
set a Start Value to the desired number for the counter and set the
Counter Type to 'static'

* Animated – If you supply both start value and end value in the widget, the counter
will increment upwards or downwards depending on the chosen Counter Type until it
reaches the end value. Speed of the count is controlled by the Animation Speed option.
Note, this counter has no memory, it will reset when a page is reloaded or changed
but it is great for a visual effect where start and end values are very close together.

* Continuous – If you want to count over a long period of time and need your
counter to continue to count irrespective of page loads then just select the
continuous option in the widget. Then choose the interval between the counter
increments, in seconds. As soon as you save the widget the counter will "start"
and will continue to tick away even if nobody is viewing your blog. Changing the
setting on an active continuous counter will not effect the count value and it will
keep count, if you wish to reset an active continuous counter just change the start value
and save the widget and the counter will restart from the new starting value.
Note: In continuous mode, animation speed and display tenths have no effect.

The counter is very configurable through the widget panel. You can define the digit
height, width and font as well as animation speed (animated mode only) and "bustedness"
(misalignment of the digits). Additionally, through "Digit Style" setting you can
specify a font, font style, colour, background or any other CSS display properties for
the digits.
Note: you cannot adjust the size of the font here as is automatically calculated from
the height / width and padding settings.

Need a flat looking counter? "Disable 3D effect" removes the CSS shading effect.


== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/
directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from
Plugins page. Go to the widgets admin page to add a counter widget, each widget
has its own settings.

counters.
